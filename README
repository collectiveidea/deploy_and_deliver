To use this task, simply set the following variables:

  set :pivotal_tracker_project_id, PROJECT_ID
  set :pivotal_tracker_token, TOKEN
  set :pivotal_tracker_ssl, false

Then, inside the task for your demo platform, add

  task :demo do
    ...
    after :deploy, 'pivotal_tracker:deliver_stories'
  end

============

Install as a plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/collectiveidea/deploy_and_deliver.git

As an added bonus, if you have Paul Dix's sax-machine gem installed (it's a SAX object parser that uses nokogiri), you'll even get a brief summary report of the delivered stories in your cap output.
