Deploy and Deliver
==================

Capistrano recipes for Pivotal Tracker.


To use this task, simply set the following variables:

  set :pivotal_tracker_project_id, PROJECT_ID
  set :pivotal_tracker_token, TOKEN

Then, inside the task for your demo platform, add

  task :demo do
    ...
    after :deploy, 'pivotal_tracker:deliver_stories'
  end


Bonus Output
============


As an added bonus, if you have Paul Dix's sax-machine gem installed (it's a SAX object parser that uses nokogiri), you'll even get a brief summary report of the delivered stories in your cap output.
